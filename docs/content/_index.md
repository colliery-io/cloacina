# Cloacina Documentation

Welcome to the Cloacina documentation. This documentation is organized to help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently.

## About Cloacina

Cloacina is a Rust library that helps you build resilient task pipelines directly within your Rust applications. Unlike standalone orchestration services, Cloacina embeds into your existing applications to manage complex multi-step workflows with:

- Automatic retries and failure recovery
- State persistence
- Type-safe workflows
- Database-backed execution
- Async-first design
- Content versioning

Whether you're building data processing applications, background job systems, or complex integration workflows, Cloacina provides the tools you need to make your task pipelines reliable, maintainable, and scalable - all within your Rust application.
