//! Server secrets support (CLOACI-I-0133 / T-0862).
//!
//! Two pieces the tenant secrets subsystem needs, shared by the CRUD routes and
//! the fleet delivery path so they agree on identity:
//!
//! 1. [`tenant_org_id`] — the single tenant(schema-name) → `org_id`
//!    ([`UniversalUuid`]) mapping. The [`SecretStore`] keys every row by an
//!    `org_id`, but a tenant is identified server-side by its schema-name string
//!    (there is no tenants table with a UUID PK — a tenant *is* a Postgres schema,
//!    see `routes/tenants.rs`). We derive a **stable, deterministic** UUID from
//!    the schema name (UUIDv5 under a fixed namespace) so the value is identical
//!    across processes/restarts without a lookup table. Both the CRUD handlers
//!    and [`ServerFleetSecretResolverFactory`] MUST route through this helper.
//!
//! 2. [`ServerFleetSecretResolverFactory`] — the concrete
//!    [`FleetSecretResolverFactory`](crate::fleet_executor::FleetSecretResolverFactory)
//!    (T-0861 handoff). Given a `(tenant, package)` scope it builds a tenant-scoped
//!    [`SecretStoreResolver`] over the tenant's schema + derived `org_id` + the
//!    server KEK, so a `$secret`-referencing fleet task actually resolves (it
//!    failed closed while the factory was `None`).

/// (`CLOACINA_SECRET_KEK`). `None` when the KEK is unset — the deployment has no
/// secrets configured, so a secret-referencing dispatch fails closed (never a
/// plaintext leak).
///
/// **Grant scope (honest v1 limitation):** the resolver is scoped to the tenant
/// (`org_id`) — the permanent isolation boundary. Per-*package* grant gating
/// (`ResolvedGrants.secrets` → a `SecretAllow::List`) is NOT yet enforced on this
/// path because per-package secret grants are not persisted server-side (they
/// live only in a package's constructor declarations, extracted from the cdylib
/// at reconciler-load time — unavailable at dispatch without loading the
/// artifact). A fleet task therefore resolves any secret *in its own tenant* that
/// it references; cross-tenant resolution is impossible. Tightening to the
/// package's granted allow-list is the follow-up once those grants are persisted.
