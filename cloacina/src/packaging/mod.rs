//! Workflow packaging functionality for creating distributable workflow packages.

//! This module provides the core library functions for compiling and packaging
//! workflow projects into distributable archives. These functions can be used
//! by CLI tools, tests, or other applications that need to package workflows.

/// 4. Creates the final package archive
