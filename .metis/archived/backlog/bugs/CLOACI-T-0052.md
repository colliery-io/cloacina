# Macro validation silently skips under lock contention

*This template includes sections for various types of tasks. Delete sections that don't apply to your specific use case.*

## Parent Initiative **[CONDITIONAL: Assigned Task]**

[[Parent Initiative]]

## Objective **[REQUIRED]**

Fix workflow! macro to fail compilation (instead of silently passing) when validation lock cannot be acquired during parallel builds.

## Backlog Item Details **[CONDITIONAL: Backlog Item]**

{Delete this section when task is assigned to an initiative}

### Type
- [x] Bug - Production issue that needs fixing
- [ ] Feature - New functionality or enhancement
- [ ] Tech Debt - Code improvement or refactoring
- [ ] Chore - Maintenance or setup work

### Priority
- [ ] P0 - Critical (blocks users/revenue)
- [x] P1 - High (important for user experience)
- [ ] P2 - Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] P3 - Low (when time permits)

### Impact Assessment **[CONDITIONAL: Bug]**
- **Affected Users**: All users doing parallel builds (cargo build -j N)
- **Severity**: HIGH - Build Safety
- **Location**: `crates/cloacina-macros/src/workflow.rs:235`
- **Reproduction Steps**:
  1. Run parallel build with multiple workflow definitions
  2. Registry lock is held by another compilation unit
  3. `try_lock()` fails, validation returns `Ok(())`
  4. Invalid workflows (circular deps, missing tasks) pass compilation
- **Expected vs Actual**:
  - Expected: Compile error when validation cannot be performed
  - Actual: Silently passes all validation when lock contention occurs

### Business Justification **[CONDITIONAL: Feature]**
- **User Value**: {Why users need this}
- **Business Value**: {Impact on metrics/revenue}
- **Effort Estimate**: {Rough size - S/M/L/XL}

### Technical Debt Impact **[CONDITIONAL: Tech Debt]**
- **Current Problems**: {What's difficult/slow/buggy now}
- **Benefits of Fixing**: {What improves after refactoring}
- **Risk Assessment**: {Risks of not addressing this}

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria

## Acceptance Criteria **[REQUIRED]**

- [ ] Return compile error instead of Ok(()) when lock cannot be acquired
- [ ] Add helpful error message suggesting retry or single-threaded compilation
- [ ] Alternatively: implement lock-free validation using atomic operations
- [ ] At minimum: emit a warning that validation was skipped
