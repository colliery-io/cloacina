# Test scenarios to implement:
# 1. Basic shared runner functionality - verify runner can execute simple workflows
# 2. Context passing - ensure context data flows correctly through execution
# 3. Multiple workflow execution - run several workflows in sequence
# 4. Success validation - verify expected outcomes and status reporting
