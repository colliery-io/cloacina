"""
Scenario 2: Workflow Execution Tests

This test file verifies workflow execution functionality including single and multi-task workflows,
dependency resolution, error handling, recovery mechanisms, and performance characteristics.

Uses shared_runner fixture for actual workflow execution.
"""

# Test scenarios to implement:
# 1. Single task workflow execution - basic task execution with context
# 2. Multi-task workflows with dependencies - sequential and parallel execution
# 3. Context propagation - data flow between tasks in workflows
# 4. Error handling - task failures, timeouts, recovery strategies
# 5. Retry mechanisms - configurable retry policies and backoff strategies
# 6. Performance testing - execution timing and resource usage
