"""
New shared pytest configuration for Cloaca test harness rewrite.

This module implements the new fixture strategy to solve connection pool exhaustion:
- Single shared runner across tests to prevent PostgreSQL "too many clients" errors
- Registry cleanup between tests instead of runner recreation
- Selective isolation for tests that truly need it

Design principles:
1. Single connection pool shared across tests
2. Registry cleanup between tests to prevent workflow/task pollution  
3. Fast cleanup avoiding slow runner.shutdown() calls
4. Selective isolation for critical tests
